# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

Would like to make it scale better with smaller screens. Worked on it all weekend and couldnt make the screens look right but logged into comuter with bigger screens and it looks right.
